    "LLM-Powered Bias and Framing Analyzer for News Media\n",
    "Idea: Develop a system that uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze, compare, and\n",
    "explain bias, framing, and linguistic patterns in how different media outlets report on the same\n",
    "event. The goal would be not to “prove” bias, but to make implicit framing choices transparent\n",
    "and help readers become more critical consumers of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?: Media outlets often present the same factual event in different ways, shaped by editorial\n",
    "priorities, political leanings, and linguistic framing.\n",
    "Traditional media bias ratings classify outlets as “left” or “right” but don’t explain how language\n",
    "conveys bias. With the rise of AI text analysis, LLMs can detect tone, emotional valence, word\n",
    "choice asymmetries, and framing devices which would allow for a more nuanced, interpretable\n",
    "understanding of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system would:\n",
    "1. Ingest multiple news articles about the same event (e.g., from CNN, Fox News, Reuters,\n",
    "2. 3. 4. Al Jazeera).\n",
    "Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, or Llama 3) to:\n",
    "○ Summarize each article objectively.\n",
    "○ Identify emotionally charged or subjective language.\n",
    "○ Highlight framing differences (who is portrayed as agent vs. victim, emphasis on\n",
    "causes vs. consequences, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare outputs and generate a concise bias/framing report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, provide a visual representation of linguistic divergence (tone polarity,\n",
    "emotional score, or topic weighting).\n",
    "Possible Add-Ons:\n",
    "Add multilingual support (compare English vs. Spanish coverage).\n",
    "Include temporal tracking (how coverage tone evolves over a week).\n",
    "Integrate fact-checking or source reliability metrics.\n",
    "Create a browser extension that performs live bias comparison for any article."

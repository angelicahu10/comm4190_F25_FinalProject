    "## Scenario 1: Job Search Matching – “Ethereal AI CareerMatch”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Discovering aligned jobs and teams through a 5-minute conversational career interview.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Narrative of Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The user opens Ethereal AI and selects the **Job & Career Matching** mode. Instead of uploading a traditional résumé only, they enter basic info (role, experience level, location) and then have a **5-minute guided conversation** with the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM asks about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work style (independent vs. collaborative)\n",
    "* What kind of managers they thrive under\n",
    "* What drains them at work\n",
    "* Their career values (impact, money, flexibility, prestige, learning, etc.)\n",
    "* Concrete past experiences (projects they enjoyed vs. hated)\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, the app:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extracts **skills, preferences, and work-style traits** from the conversation\n",
    "* Builds a structured **“career fit vector”** for the user\n",
    "* Matches this vector against a database of job postings, annotated with similar feature vectors\n",
    "* Produces a ranked list of job recommendations and recommended teams/environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, as the user gives feedback on matches (e.g., “not interested,” “interviewed here and liked it”), the system refines their profile and improves recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level steps (bullets)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mode Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * User chooses: “Find jobs & teams that fit me.”\n",
    "2. **Light Onboarding**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * App asks for: current role / experience level, location, salary expectations (optional), work authorization.\n",
    "3. **5-Minute AI Career Conversation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * LLM asks open-ended questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * “Tell me about a project that made you excited to go to work.”\n",
    "     * “Describe a time you clashed with a manager—what happened?”\n",
    "     * “What does your ideal workday look like?”\n",
    "   * User responds in free-form text or voice (transcribed).\n",
    "4. **Background Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * LLM parses the conversation into:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Core skills (e.g., Python, stakeholder management, copywriting)\n",
    "     * Work-style traits (e.g., prefers autonomy, hates micro-management)\n",
    "     * Values (impact, pay, stability, creativity, etc.)\n",
    "     * Soft attributes (risk tolerance, communication style, conflict style).\n",
    "   * Matching engine creates/updates the user’s **Career Profile Vector**.\n",
    "5. **Job Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Matching Engine compares user vector with job vectors (role requirements + inferred team culture).\n",
    "   * Generates a ranked list of jobs with explanation blurbs (“This team values experimentation and autonomy, which you indicated you prefer.”).\n",
    "6. **AI-Guided Shortlist & Prep**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * LLM helps user shortlist 3–5 best-fit positions.\n",
    "   * Offers tailored interview prep tips based on user’s strengths/weaknesses.\n",
    "7. **Feedback Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * User marks jobs as “good fit,” “meh,” or “not relevant.”\n",
    "   * System adjusts weightings in the user’s profile for future matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data needed (input to LLM/app)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structured user inputs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Name (or pseudonym), age range (optional), location, years of experience, field/industry, salary expectations (optional), work authorization.\n",
    "  * Provided via forms & dropdowns.\n",
    "* **Conversational data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Transcripts of the 5-minute conversation (free text or voice-to-text).\n",
    "  * Includes narratives of past jobs, preferred team dynamics, frustrations, ambitions.\n",
    "  * Provided to the LLM as conversation history.\n",
    "* **Job data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Job postings (title, description, requirements, location, pay, seniority, company).\n",
    "  * Optional: employer-provided culture tags (“fast-paced,” “flat hierarchy,” “high collaboration,” etc.).\n",
    "* **Annotation schema / models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Psychometric mappings (e.g., Big Five, work-motivation frameworks) used by internal models to map raw text → trait scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data created (output / internal state)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Career Profile Vector** for the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Skill embeddings vector (technical & soft skills).\n",
    "  * Work-style traits (independence, collaboration, preference for structure, etc.).\n",
    "  * Value weights (e.g., pay vs. purpose vs. flexibility).\n",
    "  * Risk tolerance & preferred company stage (startup vs. big corp).\n",
    "* **Job Embedding / Job Vector Store:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * LLM-generated vectors summarizing each job’s demands, environment, and growth profile.\n",
    "* **Match records:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * (UserID, JobID, MatchScore, Timestamp, Explanation).\n",
    "* **Feedback data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * User reactions: liked/disliked, applied, got interview, got offer.\n",
    "  * Used for retraining or fine-tuning matching logic (not necessarily the base LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to test successful completion of the scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Offline evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use historical data (user résumés + jobs they applied to and liked) to test whether Ethereal AI’s recommended jobs overlap with ground truth or outperform keyword/skills-only matching.\n",
    "* **Online metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * CTR on recommended jobs.\n",
    "  * Conversion to “apply” or “save” actions.\n",
    "  * Long-term: self-reported fit (“How well does this job fit you?”), retention at matched jobs (if integrated with partner platforms).\n",
    "* **User satisfaction surveys:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Ask: “Did this feel more accurate than other job platforms?”\n",
    "  * Likert scores for perceived understanding (“The AI understood what I want from a job”).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complications / error cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vague answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * User only replies with “idk” or “I just want a good job.”\n",
    "  * Mitigation: LLM switches to more concrete questions (“Tell me about a job you *didn’t* like and why”).\n",
    "* **Adversarial or trolling answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * User feeds absurd or contradictory info (“I want to be a brain surgeon tomorrow but hate studying”).\n",
    "  * Mitigation: detect low-quality input; flag risk; ask clarifying questions or reduce confidence and suggest broader matches.\n",
    "* **Bias & fairness issues:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Risk of reinforcing discriminatory patterns (e.g., by geography, school, age).\n",
    "  * Mitigation: fairness constraints in the matching logic; regular audits; no use of protected attributes for ranking.\n",
    "* **Privacy concerns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Sensitive career details, bad experiences with previous employers, etc.\n",
    "  * Mitigation: clear consent flows, local redaction of sensitive fields, strong data encryption, and user controls over deletion.\n",

    "## Scenario 2: Incoming College Freshman Roommate Matching – “Ethereal AI RoomSync”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Pairing incoming freshmen roommates through a conversational deep-dive into habits, boundaries, and social energy.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Narrative of Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "An incoming freshman logs into the university’s housing portal and is redirected to **Ethereal AI RoomSync**. Instead of filling an impersonal survey with boxes like “Early bird vs. night owl,” they enter a few basics and then speak with the AI for ~5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM asks about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sleep schedule and noise tolerance\n",
    "* Cleanliness habits and mess tolerance\n",
    "* Study routines\n",
    "* Social life: parties, guests, introversion/extroversion\n",
    "* Boundaries: sharing items, quiet-time, substance preferences, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereal AI turns this conversation into a **Roommate Compatibility Profile**. It then searches the pool of incoming students to find best-fit roommate pairs or small groups (for suites), balancing compatibility with diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI can also draft a **Roommate Agreement Starter** for matched roommates based on shared and differing preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level steps (bullets)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Housing Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * User logs into the university housing portal and chooses: “Help me find a compatible roommate with Ethereal AI.”\n",
    "2. **Basic Intake**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * User provides: major/intended major, dorm preference, gender preferences for roommate, and required accommodations (e.g., quiet housing, disability considerations).\n",
    "3. **5-Minute Rooming Conversation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * LLM asks:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * “Describe your ideal weekday in your dorm—from waking up to going to sleep.”\n",
    "     * “How do you feel about guests or parties in your room?”\n",
    "     * “Are you usually the messy one or the neat one at home?”\n",
    "     * “What’s something that would absolutely drive you crazy in a roommate?”\n",
    "   * User responds in free text / voice.\n",
    "4. **Trait Extraction & Profile Building**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * LLM transforms answers into structured traits:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Chronotype (early/late), noise tolerance, cleanliness level, social energy, conflict style, academic seriousness, boundaries (e.g., substances, guests, shared items).\n",
    "   * Creates **Roommate Profile Vector**.\n",
    "5. **Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Matching Engine compares vectors of all incoming freshmen.\n",
    "   * Applies rules (e.g., same dorm, compatible gender preferences, no conflicts with accommodations).\n",
    "   * Finds top N match candidates with compatibility scores.\n",
    "6. **User Review & Confirmation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * App shows 3–5 high-compatibility roommate candidates (with anonymized summaries first, then optional reveal):\n",
    "\n",
    "     * “Prefers early mornings, very neat, doesn’t like loud late-night parties, values quiet sleep.”\n",
    "   * User can “star” or “pass” on candidates.\n",
    "7. **Final Pairing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Housing system uses mutual interest + high compatibility to finalize matches.\n",
    "   * Ethereal AI generates a **Roommate Agreement Starter Document** summarizing:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Shared expectations, potential pressure points, suggested talking points for their first conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data needed (input to LLM/app)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structured intake / constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Gender preference for roommate, dorm preferences, accessibility needs, required quiet hours (if any), program/major, preferred room type (double/triple/suite).\n",
    "  * Provided via secure forms in the housing portal.\n",
    "* **Conversational data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Text/voice responses about lifestyle, habits, and boundaries.\n",
    "  * Provided as a chat transcript to the LLM.\n",
    "* **Institutional data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * List of all eligible students with their constraints, special housing assignments, and must-not-match rules (e.g., two people with conflicting accommodations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data created (output / internal state)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Roommate Profile Vector** per student:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Cleanliness score, social energy score, party tolerance, guest policy preferences, quiet-hours needs, substance preferences (where allowed to store), study seriousness, etc.\n",
    "  * Represented as a feature vector plus human-readable descriptors.\n",
    "* **Compatibility matrix:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pairwise compatibility scores between all students or between groups filtered by constraints.\n",
    "* **Match candidates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For each student: list of top-K potential roommates with compatibility scores and explanation text.\n",
    "* **Roommate Agreement Starter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A semi-structured document capturing shared preferences, differences, and suggested “house rules.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to test successful completion**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pilot with freshmen cohort:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Randomly divide students:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Control group → standard housing survey.\n",
    "    * Treatment group → Ethereal AI RoomSync.\n",
    "  * Compare:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Roommate conflict rates (reported conflicts, room change requests).\n",
    "    * Self-reported satisfaction: “I feel compatible with my roommate.”\n",
    "* **Short-term UX metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Completion rate of the 5-min conversation (do people drop off?).\n",
    "  * Perceived accuracy: “This profile describes me well.”\n",
    "* **Post-semester follow-up:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Surveys about how well their roommate match fit their habits and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complications / error cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Under-reporting or aspirational answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Students may claim they’re “very neat” or “not loud” but reality differs.\n",
    "  * Mitigation: ask scenario-based questions (“What does your desk look like during midterms?”) to catch inconsistencies; highlight that honest answers directly affect their comfort.\n",
    "* **Adversarial / trolling inputs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Students may intentionally give chaotic responses (“I never sleep, I party 24/7, I don’t care about anything”).\n",
    "  * Mitigation: detect extreme or nonsense patterns; flag for manual review or revert to more robust defaults / follow-up questions.\n",
    "* **Privacy & sensitivity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Sensitive topics (substance use, mental health, disabilities).\n",
    "  * Mitigation: only store what’s necessary; clearly separate fields that go to housing admins vs. fields only used for compatibility calculations; student consent and anonymization for peers.\n",
    "* **Over-optimization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If everyone is matched with “people exactly like them,” dorms might become socially siloed.\n",
    "  * Mitigation: include a diversity factor in matching logic (e.g., compatible on core conflict dimensions like sleep/noise, but varied on interests and majors).\n",

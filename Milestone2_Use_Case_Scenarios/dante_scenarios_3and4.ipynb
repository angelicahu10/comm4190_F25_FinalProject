    "### Short Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Discovering aligned jobs and teams through a 5-minute conversational career interview.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Narrative of Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The user opens Ethereal AI and selects the **Job & Career Matching** mode. Instead of uploading a traditional résumé only, they enter basic info (role, experience level, location) and then have a **5-minute guided conversation** with the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM asks about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work style (independent vs. collaborative)\n",
    "* What kind of managers they thrive under\n",
    "* What drains them at work\n",
    "* Their career values (impact, money, flexibility, prestige, learning, etc.)\n",
    "* Concrete past experiences (projects they enjoyed vs. hated)\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, the app:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extracts **skills, preferences, and work-style traits** from the conversation\n",
    "* Builds a structured **“career fit vector”** for the user\n",
    "* Matches this vector against a database of job postings, annotated with similar feature vectors\n",
    "* Produces a ranked list of job recommendations and recommended teams/environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, as the user gives feedback on matches (e.g., “not interested,” “interviewed here and liked it”), the system refines their profile and improves recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level steps (bullets)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mode Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * User chooses: “Find jobs & teams that fit me.”\n",
    "2. **Light Onboarding**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * App asks for: current role / experience level, location, salary expectations (optional), work authorization.\n",
    "3. **5-Minute AI Career Conversation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * LLM asks open-ended questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * “Tell me about a project that made you excited to go to work.”\n",
    "     * “Describe a time you clashed with a manager—what happened?”\n",
    "     * “What does your ideal workday look like?”\n",
    "   * User responds in free-form text or voice (transcribed).\n",
    "4. **Background Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * LLM parses the conversation into:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Core skills (e.g., Python, stakeholder management, copywriting)\n",
    "     * Work-style traits (e.g., prefers autonomy, hates micro-management)\n",
    "     * Values (impact, pay, stability, creativity, etc.)\n",
    "     * Soft attributes (risk tolerance, communication style, conflict style).\n",
    "   * Matching engine creates/updates the user’s **Career Profile Vector**.\n",
    "5. **Job Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Matching Engine compares user vector with job vectors (role requirements + inferred team culture).\n",
    "   * Generates a ranked list of jobs with explanation blurbs (“This team values experimentation and autonomy, which you indicated you prefer.”).\n",
    "6. **AI-Guided Shortlist & Prep**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * LLM helps user shortlist 3–5 best-fit positions.\n",
    "   * Offers tailored interview prep tips based on user’s strengths/weaknesses.\n",
    "7. **Feedback Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * User marks jobs as “good fit,” “meh,” or “not relevant.”\n",
    "   * System adjusts weightings in the user’s profile for future matches.\n",

    "* **Job data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Job postings (title, description, requirements, location, pay, seniority, company).\n",
    "  * Optional: employer-provided culture tags (“fast-paced,” “flat hierarchy,” “high collaboration,” etc.).\n",
    "* **Annotation schema / models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Psychometric mappings (e.g., Big Five, work-motivation frameworks) used by internal models to map raw text → trait scores.\n",

    "  * Work-style traits (independence, collaboration, preference for structure, etc.).\n",
    "  * Value weights (e.g., pay vs. purpose vs. flexibility).\n",
    "  * Risk tolerance & preferred company stage (startup vs. big corp).\n",
    "* **Job Embedding / Job Vector Store:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * LLM-generated vectors summarizing each job’s demands, environment, and growth profile.\n",
    "* **Match records:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * (UserID, JobID, MatchScore, Timestamp, Explanation).\n",
    "* **Feedback data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * User reactions: liked/disliked, applied, got interview, got offer.\n",
    "  * Used for retraining or fine-tuning matching logic (not necessarily the base LLM).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to test successful completion of the scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Offline evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use historical data (user résumés + jobs they applied to and liked) to test whether Ethereal AI’s recommended jobs overlap with ground truth or outperform keyword/skills-only matching.\n",
    "* **Online metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * CTR on recommended jobs.\n",
    "  * Conversion to “apply” or “save” actions.\n",
    "  * Long-term: self-reported fit (“How well does this job fit you?”), retention at matched jobs (if integrated with partner platforms).\n",
    "* **User satisfaction surveys:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Ask: “Did this feel more accurate than other job platforms?”\n",
    "  * Likert scores for perceived understanding (“The AI understood what I want from a job”).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complications / error cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vague answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * User only replies with “idk” or “I just want a good job.”\n",
    "  * Mitigation: LLM switches to more concrete questions (“Tell me about a job you *didn’t* like and why”).\n",
    "* **Adversarial or trolling answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * User feeds absurd or contradictory info (“I want to be a brain surgeon tomorrow but hate studying”).\n",
    "  * Mitigation: detect low-quality input; flag risk; ask clarifying questions or reduce confidence and suggest broader matches.\n",
    "* **Bias & fairness issues:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Risk of reinforcing discriminatory patterns (e.g., by geography, school, age).\n",
    "  * Mitigation: fairness constraints in the matching logic; regular audits; no use of protected attributes for ranking.\n",
    "* **Privacy concerns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Sensitive career details, bad experiences with previous employers, etc.\n",
    "  * Mitigation: clear consent flows, local redaction of sensitive fields, strong data encryption, and user controls over deletion.\n",

    "\n",
    "GOAL\n",
    "You are Ethereal AI CareerMatch, a job-matching LLM designed to collect a candidate’s work preferences, skills, environment needs, and dealbreakers, and match them with compatible job postings or employers. You facilitate high-quality self-understanding while using structured reasoning to recommend roles that align with at least 6/10 match criteria.\n",
    "PERSONA\n",
    "You speak like a thoughtful, supportive career coach. You help candidates understand their strengths and preferences. You never make assumptions about their career motivations. You lead the conversation one question at a time and help clarify ambiguities.\n",
    "NARRATIVE\n",
    "A job seeker enters CareerMatch. The AI introduces itself, explains its purpose, and begins by asking targeted questions to identify goals, skills, and preferences. After collecting enough information, CareerMatch runs a matching algorithm to compare the candidate’s responses with database job postings. Once a match is found, CareerMatch asks the user to evaluate the match and articulate why it does or does not align.\n",
    "Follow These Steps in Order\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 1: GATHER INFORMATION\n",
    "You should do this:\n",
    "Ask one question at a time, waiting for responses:\n",
    "Are you looking for a job or hiring?\n",
    "What industry or role are you interested in?\n",
    "What skills do you want to use most in your next role?\n",
    "What work environment (remote/hybrid/in-person, team preferences) do you prefer?\n",
    "What are your dealbreakers?\n",
    "What are your long-term career goals?\n",
    "Additional requirements:\n",
    "Ask sequentially.\n",
    "Explain why you ask each question.\n",
    "Infer general workstyle (collaborative, independent, structured, flexible).\n",
    "Tailor later questions to the user’s answers.\n",
    "Don’t do this:\n",
    "Don’t ask multiple questions at once.\n",
    "Don’t assume skills, experience, or job seniority.\n",
    "Don’t provide matches before gathering complete information.\n",
    "STEP 2: COMPARE RESPONSES & FIND A MATCH\n",
    "You should do this:\n",
    "Scan the job database for similar keywords, skills, and environment needs.\n",
    "Notify the user you are running the job-match algorithm.\n",
    "Present a recommended job posting including:\n",
    "Company name\n",
    "Role\n",
    "2–3 strong overlaps\n",
    "1–2 potential friction areas (honesty builds trust)\n",
    "Then ask the user to:\n",
    "Confirm whether this is a good match\n",
    "Explain why or why not\n",
    "Don’t do this:\n",
    "Don’t stop the conversation immediately after presenting the role.\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 3: WRAP UP\n",
    "You should do this:\n",
    "Close with positive reinforcement.\n",
    "Offer future assistance for job searches, career questions, or resume refinement.\n",

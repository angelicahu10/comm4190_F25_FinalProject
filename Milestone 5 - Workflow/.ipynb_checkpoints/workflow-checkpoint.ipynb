    "- **Start**: The beginning of the workflow.\n",
    "- **Collect Personalized Data**: Data collection is done through text responses, audio profiles, and images.\n",
    "- **Sort Data by Topic**: The collected data is organized and categorized according to the relevant topics and themes to facilitate processing.\n",
    "- **Split Profiles by Characteristics**: Based on the sorted topics, the profiles are broken down further by individual characteristics to create groups or segments.\n",
    "- **Match Similar Features**: The system identifies similarities across different profiles based on shared features or characteristics.\n",
    "- **Ask if User is Happy with the Match**: The user is prompted to review the matches. If satisfied, the process continues to completion.\n",
    "- **Re-evaluate Matches**: If the user is not satisfied, the system goes back to re-evaluate and refine the matches.\n",
    "- **Completed Usage**: Represents the successful conclusion of the process after the user confirms satisfaction with the matches.\n",
    "- **End**: Marks the end of the workflow once the process is completed."

    "# Creating a Workflow - How does EtheralAI work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Using mermaid create a workflow that shows how this application of LLM takes personalized data from questionnares, surveys, and inputted personal information, scans the database for other profiles, and finds similarities to match them\n",

    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Creating a workflow with Mermaid can effectively visualize the process you're describing. The following Mermaid code outlines the workflow from collecting personalized data to matching profiles based on similarities:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Start**: The beginning of the process.\n",
    "- **Collect Personalized Data**: The application starts by gathering data from three primary sources: questionnaires, surveys, and any inputted personal information.\n",
    "- **Aggregate Data**: The data collected from various sources is combined and prepared for further processing.\n",
    "- **Scan Database**: The system scans the database to retrieve existing profiles for comparison.\n",
    "- **Retrieve Other Profiles**: This step involves fetching profiles that might share similarities with the input data.\n",
    "- **Analyze Similarities**: The application analyzes the retrieved profiles to identify and evaluate common attributes and patterns.\n",
    "- **Match Profiles Based on Similarities**: The system matches profiles by finding significant similarities.\n",
    "- **Provide Recommendations/Results**: Based on the matches found, the system provides the user with personalized recommendations or results.\n",
    "- **End**: The workflow concludes with providing the results to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow provides a clear overview of the entire process, from data collection to finding and matching similar profiles.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start**: The beginning of the workflow.\n",
    "- **Collect Personalized Data**: Data collection is done through text responses, audio profiles, and images.\n",
    "- **Sort Data by Topic**: The collected data is organized and categorized according to the relevant topics and themes to facilitate processing.\n",
    "- **Split Profiles by Characteristics**: Based on the sorted topics, the profiles are broken down further by individual characteristics to create groups or segments.\n",
    "- **Match Similar Features**: The system identifies similarities across different profiles based on shared features or characteristics.\n",
    "- **Ask if User is Happy with the Match**: The user is prompted to review the matches. If satisfied, the process continues to completion.\n",
    "- **Re-evaluate Matches**: If the user is not satisfied, the system goes back to re-evaluate and refine the matches.\n",
    "- **Completed Usage**: Represents the successful conclusion of the process after the user confirms satisfaction with the matches.\n",
    "- **End**: Marks the end of the workflow once the process is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This expanded workflow reflects the addition of manual verification steps to ensure user satisfaction and iterates until a satisfactory match is found."

    "\n",
    "Start (A): The initial interaction starts with EtherealAI's introduction.\n",
    "Ask: Mentor or Mentee? (B): The user is prompted to specify whether they are a mentor or mentee, and based on this, the workflow splits into two distinct branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mentor Pathway:\n",
    "Gather Mentor Information (C1): This path collects specific details from mentors.\n",
    "Questions (D1, E1, F1): The mentor is asked about the type of mentee they want, the support they can offer, and their time commitment.\n",
    "Collect Mentor Responses (G1): The responses are gathered to prepare for matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mentee Pathway:\n",
    "Gather Mentee Information (C2): This path collects specific details from mentees.\n",
    "Questions (D2, E2, F2): The mentee is asked about their research interests, preferred learning style, and time commitment.\n",
    "Collect Mentee Responses (G2): The responses are gathered similarly for preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine Preferences (H): The gathered preferences from both pathways are combined to find matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for Matches (I): The system searches the database for compatible mentor-mentee pairings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Present Match (J): A suitable match is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Satisfaction Check (K): The user validates if the match is suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide Contact or Refine (L, M): If satisfied, the match is confirmed; otherwise, feedback is used to refine the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback Loop (N): Unsuccessful matches lead to adjustments for better alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrap Up (O): The conversation concludes with support for future queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "End: The session is completed successfully."

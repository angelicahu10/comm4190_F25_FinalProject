    "*Matching with my classmates via google form and Ethereal AI*\n",
    "\n",
    "A user in Penn's F25 \"Talking with AI\" class receives the Google Form link created. Their goal is to answer the survey questions honestly to provide the data needed for the matching algorithm. They navigate through the questions and rate their preferences on the 1-4 scales for lifestyle (e.g., \"Early Bird\" vs. \"Night Owl\"), and rate their interests (e.g., \"Video Games,\" \"Hiking\"). After submitting the form, their \"interaction\" for this phase is complete. They now wait for Ethereal AI to run the analysis and present the results.\n",

    "1. User receives Google Form\n",
    "2. User answers all questions that judge personality, preference, working style, lifestyle on a scale of 1-4\n",

    "    1. Strings: eg. \"Alice\" or \"Coffee Date\"\n",
    "    2. Integers eg. \"3\" or \"4\" from the 1-4 ranked questions \n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Created*\n",
    "    When a google form is submitted, google automatically code responses in one line that contains all of a single user's answers (includes both strings and integers). This output is in raw vector format. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing/Translation \n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding: For multiple-choice questions (like \"Ideal first date\") the \"Ideal_Date\" column becomes Ideal_Date_Coffee, Ideal_Date_Museum, etc. If a student chose \"Coffee Date,\" they get a 1 in that column and 0 in all the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization:  use of a MinMaxScaler. all the answers rescale to be a decimal (float) between 0.0 and 1.0. 1 becomes 0.0, 2 becomes 0.33, 3 becomes 0.66, and 4 becomes 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this stage, your data is a clean, all-number table. Each row is a \"user vector\" that represents a student's entire personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The AI Model \n",
    "This model's job is to compare every single student to every other student. It does this by representing each student's vector as an arrow in a high-dimensional space (one dimension for each question).\n",
    "\n",
    "It then measures the angle between every pair of arrows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A small angle means the arrows point in the same direction. This tells the AI the two students had a very similar pattern of answers. They get a high score (e.g., 0.95, a 95% match).\n",
    "\n",
    "A large angle (near 90°) means the arrows point in completely different directions. This means the students had very different or unrelated answers. They get a low score (e.g., 0.10, a 10% match).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation**\n",
    "1. make questions required on Google Form, so there are no missing components\n",
    "2. Sanity check. If we run the model and find out everyone is a 95% match with eachother it probably means the model is doing something wrong\n",
    "3. Are our questions evaluative enough? Do they reach beyond the surface level?\n",
    "4. If the input from the user is unexpected how do we program/prompt the AI to flag it so the calculation of angles is not misaligned?\n"

Alex's goal is to find their next movie, but they don't want to sift through thousands of titles. They return to the homepage, which now displays a \"Recommended for You\" row. The AI, having instantly processed Alex's new 5-star rating, has updated its recommendations. It now suggests Dune and Arrival—movies Alex hasn't seen but which other users with similar tastes (i.e., those who also loved Blade Runner 2049) have rated very highly.\n",

    "A 5-star rating becomes +1.5.\n",
